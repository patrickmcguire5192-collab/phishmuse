It was decided that the drum solos labeled \u201cFury\u201d by the band consist of a distinct double bass drum part which is absent from this drum solo and that other drum solos have been given different names (i.e. \u201cParking\u201d on Chunky Shrapnel), therefore it was decided to leave this drum solo as a show note since we do not have definitive information on what it should be called.
