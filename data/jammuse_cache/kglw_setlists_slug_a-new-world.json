The arrangement of instruments and structure of Change has been modified compared with the studio version. Though it resembles a tease of Gondii, we believe more live instances need to he heard to determine if this is intentional, or just an accentuation of the existing relationship between the songs.\r\n\r\nPoster By Jason Galea\r\n420 Standard / 120 Foil", "showyear": 2023, "showorder": 1, "opener": "Kamikaze Palm Tree", "tour_id": 5, "tourname": "2023 USA Residency", "soundcheck": "", "isverified": 1, "slug": "a-new-world", "isoriginal": 1, "original_artist": "", "venuename": "Remlinger Farms", "city": "Carnation", "state": "WA", "country": "USA", "timezone": null, "isreprise": 0, "isjam": 0, "css_class": "", "isrecommended": 0}]}
